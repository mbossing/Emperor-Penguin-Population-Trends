    "    This notebook is used as a guide on how to collect Sentinel-2 imagery and extracted colonies. Input data was replaced with filler for the user to change. Comments above lines indicate the \"what\" and \"why\" of code. Comments below a line of code represent the index at which the data should be formated.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The code is seperated into four sections:\n",
    "        \n",
    "#### 1. Image Collection\n",
    "    Before images are used for analysis, data needs to be formatted into geojson in order for the Sentinel API to package the correct information. Preliminary observations on Sentinel Playground are going to be needed before collection. Antarctica is a dynamic ecosystem that produces satellite imagery containing more clouds than snow. Finding date ranges that hold limited cloud cover is vital for collection. \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 2. Image Correction\n",
    "    Images recieved from the Sentinel API are almost always oversaturated. Correcting the pixel values by a factor of 10,000 creates observable images. Numpy is introduced in this section and lays the tracks of its subsequential use throughout the code. Additionally, the contributions of rasterio are displayed in this section.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 3. Image Clipping\n",
    "    Clipping the images requires two variables, an image and a bounding box. Our corrected images are saved as GEOTIFFS, meaning the coordinate refernce system (CRS) is implemented throughout each value in an array. The bounding box must conincide with the shape, values, and CRS of the GEOTIFF.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 4. Image Extraction\n",
    "    Guano can be extracted based on the pixel values of the array. Unfortunately, Python is incapable of seamless visualization. Through visual applications (ENVI, ArcGIS Pro), preliminary observations were made to determine the values of guano. A new image is made in which pixels are represented as either 0 or 1. 0 indictes no guano while 1 indicates likely areas of guano. A stipulation was created to determine if pixels were a 1 or a 0. Summing the pixels then allows for population estimation. This, however, is not in the code since there are multiple ways this can be done."
